   I. Executive Summary
  </h1>
  <p>
   The amendments to the Capital Requirements Directive1 by Directive      2010/76/EU (CRD III)2 relate to the approach for capturing Incremental      Default and Migration risks in the trading book, commonly referred to as      the incremental risk capital charge (IRC). According to these amendments,      the predecessor of the EBA, the Committee of European Banking Supervisors      (CEBS)3 is tasked with monitoring the range of practices in this area and      drawing up guidelines in order to secure a level playing field.
  </p>
  <p>
   The transposition by national supervisory authorities of the changes to      the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) by Directive 2010/76/EU (CRD III)      entered into force on 31 December2011.
  </p>
  <p>
   Providing guidance on the IRC modelling approaches employed by credit      institutions using the Internal Model Approach (`IMA') for the calculation      of the required capital for specific interest risk in the trading book, is      seen as an important means of addressing weaknesses in the regulatory      capital framework and in the risk management of financial institutions      that contributed to the turmoil in global financial markets. The      incremental risk charge is intended to complement additional standards      being applied to the value-at-risk (VaR) modelling framework in the      trading book and is expected to contribute to a more robust financial      system.
  </p>
  <p>
   Among other things, the first chapter of the Guidelines, 'Scope of      Application' elaborates on the positions that are subject to IRC modelling      and the permanent partial use of IRC models. The second chapter, on      `Individual Modelling' provides guidance on the use and sources of      individual parameters and ratings in IRC modelling. The third chapter, on      'Interdependence' discusses i) the correlation between default and      migration events, ii) copula assumptions, iii) systemic risk factors and      iv) portfolio concentrations. Chapter four on `Migration matrices'      elaborates on the use of transition matrices. Chapter five on the      'Constant level of risk assumption over the one-year capital horizon'      provides guidance on, among other issues, the use of liquidity horizons      and the rebalancing of positions. Chapter six on 'Hedging' goes into more      detail on the modelling of diversification effects. The seventh chapter,      on 'P&amp;L valuation' elaborates on how ratings changes are turned into      impact on market prices and on the computation of P&amp;L. Chapter eight      on `Liquidity horizons' provides guidance on defining a liquidity horizon      as well as on the key factors for determining the relevant liquidity      horizon as well as on the monitoring of liquidity horizons. Chapter nine      on 'Validation' elaborates on the validation process for IRC models.      Chapter ten on 'Use tests' and chapter eleven, `Documentation' describe      the minimum requirements for the use of IRC models and their related      documentation. Chapter twelve on `IRC approaches based on different      parameters' provides guidance on how to deal with IRC models that are `not      fully
  </p>
  <p>
   compliant with the IRC approach'. Chapter thirteen on the `Frequency of      calculation' elaborates on the minimum calculation requirements of the      IRC.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Guidelines on the IRC are expected to contribute to a level playing      field among credit institutions and to enhance convergence of supervisory      practices among the competent authorities across the EU. It is expected      that national competent authorities in the EU will implement the      Guidelines by incorporating them within their supervisory procedures      within six months after publication of the final guidelines. After that      date, the competent authorities must ensure that institutions comply with      the Guidelines effectively.

   II. Background and Rationale
  </h1>
  <p>
   The agreement reached in July 20054 between the Basel Committee on Banking      Supervision (BCBS) and the International Organisation of Securities      Commissions (IOSCO), contained several improvements to the capital regime      for trading book positions. Among these revisions was a new requirement      for banks that model interest rate risk, to measure and hold capital      against default risk that is incremental to any default risk captured in      the bank's value-at-risk (VaR) model. The incremental default risk charge      was incorporated into the trading book capital regime in response to the      increasing amount of exposure in banks' trading books to credit risk,      often related to illiquid products, whose risk is not reflected in the      VaR.
  </p>
  <p>
   In October 2007, the BCBS released guidelines for computing capital for      incremental default risk for public comment. At its meeting in March 2008,      the Basel Committee reviewed comments received and decided to expand the      scope of the capital charge. The decision was taken in light of the recent      credit market turmoil where a number of major banking institutions had      experienced large losses, most of which were sustained in the banks'      trading books. Most of those losses were not captured in the 99%/10-day      VaR. Since observed losses had not arisen from actual defaults, but rather      from credit migrations combined with a widening of credit spreads and the      loss of liquidity, applying an incremental risk charge covering default      risk only, did not appear to besufficient.
  </p>
  <p>
   In January 2009, the BCBS proposed supplementing the current VaR-based      trading book framework with, among other measures, an incremental risk      capital charge (IRC), which covers default risk as well as migration risk      for unsecuritised credit products and a stressed value-at-risk (Stressed      VaR) requirement5.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the process of refining capital requirements for market risk, the BCBS      conducted a quantitative impact study6. In summer 2009, the Trading Book      Group of the BCBS (TBG) investigated the impact of the provisions of the      BCBS 'Revisions to the Basel II market risk framework' and the `Guidelines      for computing capital for incremental risk in the trading book'      consultation papers published in January 2009, focusing (generally) on big      internationally active banks with extensive trading activities.
  </p>
  <p>
   The amendments to the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) by Directive      2010/76/EU (CRD III)7 relating to the IRC in the trading book are a direct      translation of the proposals from the BCBS.
  </p>
  <p>
   The European Banking Authority (EBA) is tasked with monitoring the range      of practices in this area and to provide guidelines on the compliance of      IRC modelling approaches with the CRD.
  </p>
  <p>
   The objectives of the guidelines on the IRC are to:
  </p>
  <p>
   I. achieve a common understanding among the competent authorities          across the EU on IRC modelling in order to enhance convergence of          supervisory practices;
  </p>
  <p>
   II. provide guidance on the compliance of IRC modelling approaches          with the CRD;
  </p>
  <p>
   III.create more transparency for credit institutions when implementing IRC      into the calculation of the required capital for market risk in the      trading book and into their risk management practices; and to
  </p>
  <p>
   IV. create a level playing field between credit institutions in this          area.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Guidelines presented in this paper do not aim to be a comprehensive      set of rules, but rather to complement the new CRD provisions relating to      the IRC where additional guidance was deemed necessary or appropriate by      the EBA.
  </p>
  <p>
   Given that the Guidelines discussed in this paper do not go beyond the      provisions of the CRD but rather clarify how the rules are to be applied      in practice, a detailed assessment of the costs and benefits associated      with them is not required. These costs and benefits are unlikely to be      incremental to those identified in the EU Commission's Impact Assessment      accompanying its CRDIII proposal.

   III. EBA Guidelines on the IRC
  </h1>
  <h3 role="sectionHeading">
   Status of these Guidelines
  </h3>
  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="1.">
   1.
  </h5>
  <p>
   This document contains guidelines issued pursuant to Article  of      Regulation (EU) No 93/20 of the European Parliament and of the Council      of 24 November 20 establishing a European Supervisory Authority      (European Banking Authority), amending Decision No 7/2009/EC and      repealing Commission Decision 2009/78/EC ('the EBA Regulation'). In      accordance with Article (3) of the EBA Regulation, competent authorities      and financial market participants must make every effort to comply with      the guidelines.
  </p>
  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="2.">
   2.
  </h5>
  <p>
   Guidelines set out the EBA's view of appropriate supervisory practices      within the European System of Financial Supervision or of how Union law      should be applied in a particular area. The EBA therefore expects all      competent authorities and financial market participants to whom guidelines      are addressed to comply. Competent authorities to whom guidelines apply      should comply by incorporating them into their supervisory practices as      appropriate (e.g. by amending their legal framework or their supervisory      rules and/or guidance or supervisory processes), including where      particular guidelines are directed primarily at institutions.
  </p>
  <h3 role="sectionHeading">
   Notification Requirements
  </h3>
  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="3.">
   3.
  </h5>
  <p>
   According to Article 16( of the EBA Regulation, competent authorities      must notify the EBA as to whether they comply or intend to comply with      these guidelines, or otherwise with reasons for non-compliance, by      16.07.2012. In the absence of any notification by this deadline, competent      authorities will be considered by the EBA as non-compliant. Notifications      should be sent by submitting the form provided at Section V to      compliance@eba.europa.eu with the reference 'EBA/GL/2012/. Notifications      should be submitted by persons with appropriate authority to report      compliance on behalf of their competent authorities.
  </p>
  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="4.">
   4.
  </h5>
  <p>
   The notification of competent authorities mentioned in the previous      paragraph shall be published on the EBA website, as per article 16 of EBA      Regulation.

   Title I - Subject matter, Scope and Definitions
  </h2>
  <h4 content_type="subsubheading" data-num="1." role="sectionHeading">
   1. Subject matter
  </h4>
  <p>
   These guidelines aim at achieving a common understanding among the      competent authorities across the EU on IRC modelling in order to      contribute to a level playing field in line with Annex V of Directive      2006/49/EC, as amended by Directive 2010/76/EU.
  </p>
  <h4 content_type="subsubheading" data-num="2.">
   2. Institutional scope and level of application
  </h4>
  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="1.">
   1.
  </h5>
  <p>
   Competent authorities should require the institutions mentioned in      paragraph 2 below to comply with the provisions laid down in these      Guidelines on IRC.
  </p>
  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="2.">
   2.
  </h5>
  <p>
   These Guidelines should apply to institutions using an Internal Model      Approach (IMA) for the purpose of calculating the capital requirements for      specific interest risk in the trading book.
  </p>
  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="3.">
   3.
  </h5>
  <p>
   The guidelines apply to institutions at the level (solo and/or      consolidated) on which the relevant internal model is authorised to be      used by the relevant competent authority, unless stated otherwise in these      Guidelines.
  </p>
  <h4 content_type="subsubheading" data-num="3." role="sectionHeading">
   3. Definitions
  </h4>
  <p>
   In these guidelines the following definitions should apply:
  </p>
  <p>
   a. The term
   <i>
    institutions
   </i>
   should mean credit institutions and          investment firms as set out in Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC.
  </p>
  <p>
   b. The term
   <i>
    permanent partial use
   </i>
   in point 8 of these          Guidelines, should mean that certain positions, which are excluded          from specific risk VaR and from the application of the IRC, based on          Annex V, point 6 of Directive 2006/49/EC, are subject to the          standardised approach for specific interest rate risk.

   A. Material scope of application
  </h3>
  <h4 content_type="subsubheading" data-num="4.">
   4. Positions subject to calculation of the IRC
  </h4>
  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="1.">
   1.
  </h5>
  <p>
   Calculation of the IRC should include all long and short positions      subject to a modelled charge for specific interest rate risk, with the      exception of the items referred to at point 5 below.
  </p>
  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="2.">
   2.
  </h5>
  <p>
   In particular, the following positions should be included, if they are      part of the trading book:
  </p>
  <p>
   i. bonds issued by central governments ("sovereigns"), even in cases where      the application of the standardised approach would result in a 0 % risk      charge for specific interest rate risk;
  </p>
  <p>
   ii. structured bonds, credit linked notes or similar debt instruments if      they do not embed exposures to securitisations or n-th-to-default credit      derivatives;
  </p>
  <p>
   iii. money market loans.
  </p>
  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="3.">
   3.
  </h5>
  <p>
   Positions resulting from the application of the look-through approach      to the shares of collective undertakings (CIUs), when such positions, if      they directly belonged to the trading book, would be included in the      calculation of the IRC according to point 4.1 above, should also be      included. When the application of the look-through approach to the shares      of CIUs is not possible, the standardised approach should be used.
  </p>
  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="4.">
   4.
  </h5>
  <p>
   The following positions are not considered securitisations and should      therefore be included in the calculation of IRC, if they are part of the      trading book:
  </p>
  <p>
   a. covered bonds (e.g. `Pfandbriefe') since such bonds are simply          collateralised and not asset-backed;
  </p>
  <p>
   b. asset-backed securities that do not meet the definition of          'securitisation position' in Article 3(1)(f) of Directive 2006/49/EC,          which refers to Article 4(36) of Directive 2006/48/EC. For example          where cash flows from the underlying pool are allocated to securities          holders on a pro-rata basis and therefore have no tranching (e.g.          pass-through MBS).
  </p>
  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="5.">
   5.
  </h5>
  <p>
   Positions in defaulted debt held in the trading book should, where      material, be included in the calculation of the IRC. In this case, they      may be excluded from the migration element of the IRC if, given the      specific model framework of the institution, defaulted positions bear no      migration risk (for example if default is modelled as an absorbing state).      Where these positions are excluded for materiality reasons, an institution      must be able to demonstrate that they are not material. In all cases, any      material risk of price changes of defaulted debt, as driven by uncertain      recovery marks, should be capitalised.
  </p>
  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="6.">
   6.
  </h5>
  <p>
   The definition of default in the case of paragraph 5 above, should be      consistent with the definition of default in ratings used for modelling      purposes.
  </p>
  <h4 content_type="subsubheading" data-num="5.">
   5. Positions not subject to calculation of the IRC
  </h4>
  <p>
   The following items should be excluded from the calculation of the IRC:
  </p>
  <p>
   a. securitisations;
  </p>
  <p>
   b. n-th-to-default credit derivatives; and
  </p>
  <p>
   c. positions subject to the specific interest rate risk charge and              different from securitisations or n-th-to-default credit              derivatives if they are positions of the correlation trading              portfolio (CTP).
  </p>
  <h4 content_type="subsubheading" data-num="6.">
   6. Positions in equity and equity derivatives
  </h4>
  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="1.">
   1.
  </h5>
  <p>
   Competent authorities may allow the inclusion in the IRC of listed      equity positions and derivatives positions based on listed equity subject      to the following conditions:
  </p>
  <p>
   i. the related positions in equity and credit instruments are jointly          managed by an identified trading unit (e.g. arbitrage between          convertible bonds and equity);
  </p>
  <p>
   ii. procedures for the measurement and management of joint credit and      equity risk are in place for the relevant trading unit; and
  </p>
  <p>
   i. all equity positions of the relevant trading unit are included, in          order to avoid cherry-picking.
  </p>
  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="2.">
   2.
  </h5>
  <p>
   If a listed equity or a derivative instrument based on listed equity is      included in the computation of the IRC measure, the default of any of      these instruments is deemed to occur if the related debt defaults.
  </p>
  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="3.">
   3.
  </h5>
  <p>
   Notwithstanding the inclusion in the IRC of positions in listed equity      or in derivative instruments based on listed equity, a specific risk      capital charge for these positions - capturing event risk in the case of      the use of an internal model - must still be calculated.
  </p>
  <h4 content_type="subsubheading" data-num="7.">
   7. Positions in the institution's own debt
  </h4>
  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="1.">
   1.
  </h5>
  <p>
   Long positions in the institution's own debt, which may arise from      trading or market-making activity in its own bonds, should be included      within the scope of the IRC model but only migration risk should be taken      into account for the calculation of the charge.
  </p>
  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="2.">
   2.
  </h5>
  <p>
   Short positions in the institution's own debt, which may arise from the      inclusion in the trading book of own-debt issues (e.g. structured bonds or      money market trades) or from buying protection on the institution's own      name (e.g. via an index) should be included within the scope of the IRC      model but only migration risk should be taken into account for the      calculation of the charge. The default risk of short positions in own debt      should not be modelled in the IRC approach.
  </p>
  <h4 content_type="subsubheading" data-num="8." role="sectionHeading">
   8. Permanent partial use
  </h4>
  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="1.">
   1.
  </h5>
  <p>
   Where use is made of the provisions of the CRD on the permanent partial      use, the rationale for this should be carefully documented and analysed to      show it is not intended to deliver a charge that is less conservative than      if all positions were within the specific risk VaR and the IRC model.
  </p>
  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="2.">
   2.
  </h5>
  <p>
   Permanent partial use of the IRC should not apply to sovereign bonds      and derivative products referencing sovereign bonds since - from a      modelling point of view - the inclusion of these positions in the specific      risk model and consequently in the IRC framework is not considered to be      particularly challenging.
  </p>
  <h3 content_type="subheading" data-num="B.">
   B. Individual Modelling
  </h3>
  <h4 content_type="subsubheading" data-num="9." role="sectionHeading">
   9. Soundness standard comparable to IRB
  </h4>
  <p>
   Unless otherwise specified in these guidelines, the soundness standard      comparable to IRB applicable to IRC is: a capital horizon of 1 year and a      confidence interval of 99.9 %.
  </p>
  <h4 content_type="subsubheading" data-num="10." role="sectionHeading">
   10. Qualitative criteria
  </h4>
  <p>
   All aspects of the IRC approach applied should be thoroughly documented.      This includes documentation of any analysis undertaken to motivate      assumptions, estimation techniques, proxies, or simplifications. Any such      decisions should be justified at the request of the competent authority.
  </p>
  <h4 content_type="subsubheading" data-num="11." role="sectionHeading">
   11. Source of ratings
  </h4>
  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="1.">
   1.
  </h5>
  <p>
   Institutions' IRC approaches may rely on either internal or external      ratings. Internal ratings used for IRC purposes should be consistent with      how they are derived in the IRB approach.
  </p>
  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="2.">
   2.
  </h5>
  <p>
   Institutions should have procedures in place for inferring a rating for      non-rated positions. When credit spreads are available, their use for      inferring a rating should be clearly documented. Likewise, the use of a      default rating (i.e. a `fall-back' rating for positions where no      observable data can be used to infer a rating) should be documented. Any      rating system applied should, as far as possible, differentiate between      relevant groups of positions.
  </p>
  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="3.">
   3.
  </h5>
  <p>
   An institution should have in place a documented hierarchy of sources      of ratings for determining the rating of an individual position. If an      institution uses different sources of ratings (e.g. internal and external      ratings or different external rating
  </p>
  <p>
   agencies' estimates), it should consistently map the ratings into a common      Masterscale.
  </p>
  <h4 content_type="subsubheading" data-num="12." role="sectionHeading">
   12. Source of PDs and LGDs
  </h4>
  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="1.">
   1.
  </h5>
  <p>
   Where an institution has approved PD estimates or PD and LGD, estimates      as part of the internal ratings based approach (IRBA) set out in Article      84 of directive 2006/48/EC, this data may be used as a source for      obtaining PD and LGD estimates for IRC purposes, as well.
  </p>
  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="2.">
   2.
  </h5>
  <p>
   Where , in the latter cases, an institution does not have approved IRB      PDs and/or LGDs or where IRB PDs and/or LGDs do not exist for an issuer or      a security in the trading book, these should be computed using a      methodology consistent with the IRB methodology, which would then require      a separate approval by the competent authority for use in the IRC.
  </p>
  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="3.">
   3.
  </h5>
  <p>
   Risk neutral PDs should not be acceptable as estimates of observed      (historical) PDs for the modelling of the rating migration or default. If      PDs implied from market prices are used, the institution should do the      relevant corrections to obtain the real measure probability from risk      neutral probabilities, and it should compare the outcomes of its      methodology against the historical record.
  </p>
  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="4.">
   4.
  </h5>
  <p>
   Alternatively, the use of PDs and LGDs provided by external sources      (e.g. rating agencies) may also be used by institutions, as they are      generally considered appropriate.
  </p>
  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="5.">
   5.
  </h5>
  <p>
   Institutions should establish a hierarchy ranking their preferred      sources for their PDs and LGDs, in order to avoid the cherry-picking of      parameters.
  </p>
  <h3 content_type="subheading" data-num="C.">
   C. Interdependence
  </h3>
  <h4 content_type="subsubheading" data-num="13." role="sectionHeading">
   13. Correlations between default and migration events
  </h4>
  <p>
   Institutions' IRC models should include the impact of correlations between      default or migration events in a way that is consistent with their      purpose, which is to capture credit risk correlations between different      issuers. The assumptions on which their estimation is based should be      consistent with the assumptions used in the simulation. The methodology      should be documented and duly justified. The approach should be adequate      and conservative enough to capture the interdependence between the risk      drivers of credit risk events such as defaults and migrations. This would      include, for example, the obligation that, if institutions choose to      estimate their correlation parameters from the prices of traded      securities, the estimates should be updated frequently.
  </p>
  <h4 content_type="subsubheading" data-num="14." role="sectionHeading">
   14. Copula assumptions

   Although interdependence between issuers is frequently modelled in a      similar way to the regulatory IRB framework, using a combination of an      idiosyncratic (i.e. individual) and one or more systemic risk factors, no      modelling approach is prescribed by these Guidelines, provided that an      institution meets all the relevant qualitative and validation requirements      to ensure that its approach is suitably conservative.

  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="1.">

  </h5>
  <p>
   Transition matrices for modelling the rating migration process should      be based on historical migration data using either external sources (i.e.      rating agencies) or internal sources. Matrices from external sources      should be preferred in cases where internal historical data is sparse.      Institutions should ensure that the amount of historical data is      sufficient to derive robust, accurate and statistically consistent      estimates. Institutions should validate the robustness of transition      matrices particularly in relation to higher rating categories, where a few      severe downgrades or defaults can affect the migration frequency      significantly. In accordance with the requirement for a `standard of      soundness comparable to IRB' which the CRD establishes, a minimum      historical observation period of 5 years is required.
  </p>
  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="2.">
   2.
  </h5>
  <p>
   Separate transition matrices may be applied for specific groups of      issuers and specific geographical areas. Depending on (i) the composition      of the institutions' portfolio, (ii) the availability of accurate      transition matrices and (iii) possible differences in migration      characteristics across products, issuers and/or geographical areas, a      balanced decision should be made on the set of transition matrices used.      Such a decision should consider (i) the choice of the (internal or      external) source in combination with an analysis of the overlap and/or      possible mismatch between the institutions' portfolio and the assets      underlying the transition matrix; (ii) the motivation for any weighting      scheme (also for the use of equal weights); and (iii) the size of the      historical window. Institutions should develop one (or more when relevant      data is available) transition matrix that is specific to sovereign      obligors.
  </p>
  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="3.">
   3.
  </h5>
  <p>
   When default is modelled as an absorbing state, transition matrices      should be adjusted to ensure that this absorbing state does not conflict      with internal PD estimates. Similarly, transition matrices where `NR'      (`Not rated') or another column is an absorbing state for withdrawn      ratings or non-rated exposures can be adjusted. Any such adjustments      should be documented, and the impact of the specified adjustment should be      included as part of the documentation.

  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="4.">

  </h5>
  <p>
   Transition matrices, in general, relate to a one-year horizon. Where      shorter horizon matrices are required, which is the case when liquidity      horizons shorter than one year are used, the corresponding transition      matrices cannot always be computed directly and approximations are      required. Both the approximations and the motivation for specific      assumptions applied in this process should be documented (e.g. when      generator matrices are used). These assumptions should also be assessed in      order to verify that they remain valid over time. As part of the      validation process a matrix based on a generator could be calculated for a      horizon identical to the originating matrix's horizon in order to assess      the difference resulting from the process of developing the generator      matrix.

  </h5>
  <p>
   When modelling a constant level of risk over the one-year capital      horizon, institutions should rebalance or roll-over positions at the end      of each liquidity
  </p>
  <p>
   horizon to new positions, so as to ensure the same initial level of risk      as at the start of the liquidity horizon.

  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="2.">

  </h5>
  <p>
   When assuming a one-year constant position, which implies not adopting      liquidity horizons, institutions should consistently apply to all IRC      positions an instantaneous shock over the one-year capital horizon      (referred to as `one-year constant position assumption').
  </p>
  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="3.">
   3.
  </h5>
  <p>
   From a modelling perspective, the constant level of risk may be      reflected as the replacement of positions, if a migration or a default has      occurred over the liquidity horizon, with positions that have risk      characteristics equivalent to those of the original positions at the start      of the liquidity horizon.
  </p>
  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="4.">
   4.
  </h5>
  <p>
   Modelling a constant level of risk over the one-year capital horizon      may be achieved, for example, on the basis of the approach outlined      hereafter. With respect to calculating losses over liquidity horizons, an      institution may choose to assume that instantaneous shocks are applied to      ratings (or spreads). This implies that, in this case, the institution      does not have to integrate the time effect: positions keep their original      residual maturities at the end of each liquidity horizon; in other words,      there is no ageing of positions. Furthermore, there is no need to consider      potential changes in market conditions when revaluating the portfolio at      the time of rebalancing (in particular, credit spreads by rating can be      kept constant). As a result, measurement of losses within IRC does not      take into account the timing of each migration or default event, and the      P&amp;L is computed as of today.
  </p>
  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="5.">
   5.
  </h5>
  <p>
   Modelling the ageing of positions should not be allowed in IRC      modelling, given the expected tremendous challenges and the observed      difficulties associated with modelling the ageing of positions, together      with the substantial regulatory arbitrage this could result in. This      justifies that, at the present stage, a conservative approach is      preferred.

  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="2.">

  <p>
   Diversification effects associated with long and short positions may      only be recognised by explicitly modelling gross long and short positions      in the different instruments. In any case, institutions should demonstrate      that diversification or hedging effects are not overestimated; in      particular maturity mismatches should be reflected in models.
  </p>
  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="3.">
   3.

  <p>
   In order to reflect basis risk appropriately, where this risk is      material, valuation for the purposes of the IRC for related positions      (like, for example, bonds and CDSs
  </p>
  <p>
   on the same obligor) should be differentiated. Thus, net long and net      short positions that reference similar - but not identical - underlying      assets should not result in an IRC measure equal to zero. Where basis risk      is not accounted for, institutions should provide proof that this risk is      not material.
  </p>
  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="4.">

  <p>
   Institutions should reflect the impact within the liquidity horizon of      maturity mismatches between long and short positions (for example if a CDS      matures before the underlying bond and the default happens after the CDS      maturity), if the resulting risks are material. Therefore, an institution      should be able to compute the P&amp;L taking into account the impact of      potential maturity mismatches between long and short positions. An      institution should at least be able to prove that the above- mentioned      risk is not a material risk, otherwise it should have to model the risk      accordingly.

  <p>
   Institutions may choose any of the approaches available to convert      simulated rating variations into price variations, including using either      absolute or relative differences between average spreads by rating class.      The methodology used should be consistently applied and documented. In all      cases, the relevant spread data should be as differentiated as possible      according to the different categories of positions. The approach should be      shown to differentiate sufficiently between positions with different      pricing characteristics to the satisfaction of the competent authorities.      For example, a credit default swap (CDS) and the underlying bond would      have to be valued separately.

  <p>
   With regard to point 18 of these Guidelines, an institution may      consistently assume an instantaneous rating change, implying that market      conditions at the time determine prices after migration, taking into      account any idiosyncratic valuation impact that would be expected when a      migration event occurs (see point .5 below), ignoring all time effects      on the price of an instrument whose rating changed.

  </h5>
  <p>
   In the case of a rating migration, the variation of market prices      should be recalculated. Full revaluation should be required unless an      institution can prove that its pricing approach sufficiently reflects even      the large price changes that are to be expected from a change in rating.      This may be done as a pre-calculation in the sense that a vector of prices      for each rating state might be an input in an IRC calculation. The impact      of a rating migration on market prices should be estimated using either      currently observed market data (e.g. spreads); or an average of historical      market data observed over a maximum period of one year or any other      relevant period
  </p>
  <p>
   subject to approval by competent authorities. Historical PDs should not be      used for discounting purposes when performing a full revaluation upon a      rating change as they do not sufficiently reflect current market prices.

   Positions migrating into the default state should be valued on the      basis of the recovery rate or the loss given default rate. The recovery      rate should be applied to the notional value of the position unless the      estimates are derived relative to the market values of positions. It has      to be shown to the satisfaction of the competent authorities that the      estimate is appropriately differentiated for different categories of      obligors and instruments. Calculations should be coherent between      instruments. Any other approach should be duly justified and documented,      in particular if generic market LGDs are used, and the institution should      have a documented process in place describing on which criteria LGDs for      individual positions are to be adjusted.

   The model should capture divergences arising from differences in credit      event definition, seniority in the capital structure or exposure to      different entities within a group. This could, for example, be implemented      through the use of stochastic recovery rates. Defaulted bonds are in      principle included in the IRC portfolio if they are in the trading book      (cf. Paragraph 4.5). Therefore, the model should capture the risk that      post-default LGD marks or realisations may diverge from their pre-default      estimates. The initial LGD or recovery rate applied to individual      defaulted positions would have to be updated with the same frequency for      the IRC as for the P&amp;L calculation and the LGDs must be in line with      the numbers used for the P&amp;L calculation.

Market data used to evaluate the      positions to which the shocks generated by the rating migration are      applied should be the latest available market data at the time of      computation of the IRC.

  </h5>
  <p>
   A wide range of criteria can indicate the liquidity of a position,      based on past experience, market structure, and the quality or complexity      of the product. Institutions should identify a range of criteria that they      believe materially define the liquidity horizon of their portfolios. These      criteria include:
  </p>
  <p>
   i. Market activity, as reflected in number and volume of trades in an          instrument or name, or in the size of historical bid-offer spreads;
  </p>
  <p>
   ii. Market structure, such as the number and distribution of market makers      and quotes;
  </p>
  <p>
   iii. Size of position (relative to average trading volumes/overall market      size);

  <p>
   v. Investment quality (e.g. credit rating);

   v. Geographical location of issuer;

   vi. Maturity.

  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="3.">
   3.
  </h5>
  <p>
   At least one of the criteria considered in the determination of a      liquidity horizon should be directly linked to the concentrated nature of      positions (for example, through the size of position relative to the      market size or average trading volumes), given that the liquidity horizon      is expected to be greater for positions that are concentrated, reflecting      the longer period needed to liquidate such positions.
  </p>
  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="4.">
   4.
  </h5>
  <p>
   Positions should be systematically assessed against the criteria chosen      and allocated to liquidity horizons accordingly (with a floor of 3      months). Where limited data is available on a position or set of      positions, institutions should be conservative in determining the relevant      liquidity horizon.

  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="5.">

  <p>
   The approach applied to link a criterion to a longer or shorter      liquidity horizon should be documented and supported by historical      evidence including evidence based on experience of liquidating similar      positions during stressed periods, to ensure that assumptions which appear      theoretically logical but are not true in practice are not mistakenly used      in the analysis - for example it may not be true in

  <p>
   all cases that a lower credit rating implies a longer liquidity horizon if      there is an active market in certain types of positions with low credit      ratings. For example, in the case of the use of historical bid-offer      spreads, institutions may set thresholds which determine which liquidity      horizon a position is allocated to - the choice of these thresholds should      be justified.

   ii. The IRC model for measuring default and migration risk over the      liquidity horizon should take into account objective data over the      relevant horizon and include a comparison of risk estimates for a      rebalanced portfolio with that of a portfolio with fixed positions;
  </p>

   objective data in a conceptually sound framework. In particular, the      impact of different copula assumptions should be analysed, for example by      testing the impact of different distributional assumptions.

   An institution may use an approach to capturing incremental default and      migration risks that does not comply with all the provisions of Annex II      Paragraph 3 of Directive 20/76/EU (referred to as a `not fully compliant      IRC approach' in the remainder of this section):
  </p>
  <p>
   i. when this not fully compliant IRC approach is consistent with the          institution's internal methodologies for identifying, measuring and          managing risks;
  </p>
  <p>
   ii. and when the institution is able to demonstrate that its approach          results in a capital requirement that is at least as high as if it was          based on an approach in full compliance with all IRC requirements.

   The institution should provide all necessary information concerning      elements of the institution's IRC approach that are considered, either by      the institution or by its supervisor, as not fully compliant.

  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="3.">

  <p>
   On the basis of the information provided, the competent national      supervisor should decide whether the IRC approach used - or planned to be      used - by the institution should be considered as a non-compliant IRC      approach or could be considered as a non-fully compliant IRC approach      according to point 28.4 below. In particular, if an IRC approach is      recognised as a non-compliant IRC approach, this would in principle entail      the application of the standardised approach for specific risk to the      positions covered by the non-compliant IRC approach.

   In order to have its approach recognised as a non-fully compliant IRC      approach, an institution should demonstrate, to the satisfaction of its      supervisor, that the institution's IRC approach results in a capital      requirement that is at least as high as if it were based on a fully      compliant IRC approach.

  <p>
   Calculation of the IRC should be at least weekly. However, institutions      can choose to compute the measure more frequently. If, for example, an      institution decides on a weekly IRC computation, for the daily calculation      of capital requirements based on internal models the following should      apply:
  </p>
  <p>
   i. The same IRC number should be used for five subsequent business          days following the running of the IRC model;
  </p>
  <p>
   ii. With respect to the calculation of the average IRC numbers on the          preceding 12 weeks, institutions should use the previous twelve IRC          weekly numbers to compute that average.
  </p>
  <h5 content_type="paragraph" data-num="2.">

  </h5>
  <p>
   The institution should be able to prove that, on the day of the week      chosen for the IRC calculation, its portfolio is representative of the      portfolio held during the week and that the chosen portfolio does not lead      to a systematic underestimation of the IRC numbers when computed weekly.

      The status of the guidelines is not clear. While the paper referred            to as 'guidance' the wording in their scope and level of application            is more consistent with rules-based regulation. Furthermore there            are examples in the paper where it would be difficult for a firm to            comply with both the national rules and guidance and the EBA's            proposed guidelines.

      Competent authorities have a legal requirement to notify the EBA if            they comply or intend to comply with the guidelines within two            months after publication. In order to maximize harmonization between            competent authorities and member states, the EBA has chosen to write            the guidelines in a more rules-based manner.

      The timing of EBA's guidelines are unfortunate. Most banks have            already submitted detailed model documentation for approval and            often received approval under existing national rules and guidance.            Where the final EBA guidelines differ from the BCBS

      The timing for making the model changes remains unclear: we            understand that the EBA will issue final guidance late in the first            quarter of 2012 and that there will then be a six month period in            which the guidance will be transposed into national requirements at            which point banks would have to be compliant. If so the timetable is            too short to implement any potential model changes.

      Indeed, as mentioned in the guidelines the EBA expects that            competent authorities will implement the guidelines within six            months after publication of the final version. Indirectly this means            that EBA expects institutions to comply with the guidelines as soon            as they are implemented by the competent authorities in their            supervisory practices, but in any case within six months after            publication of the final guidelines. The EBA believes sufficient            time is given to competent authorities and institutions to implement            the guidelines.

      The Basel Committee's Fundamental Review of the Trading Book will            most likely lead to a comprehensive change in the treatment of            market risk. It's expect that the Basel Committee will issue new            proposals before the end of 2012. The adjustments to the models set            out in these EBA consultation papers may be redundant following the            Fundamental Review.

      The issue of whether to use Through The Cycle or Point in Time            probabilities centres on an important issue around the role of            capital which has been raised in the Fundamental Review feedback            from industry (principle 8). For wind-up capital, which we refer to            as Level 1 capital, PiT probabilities are probably more appropriate.            However for Level 2 capital, which we associate with going concern            capital, TTC probabilities are arguably more appropriate. This            remains a matter for debate however; the important point here is            that consistency is needed from regulators (principle 6) and this            will only be possible when fundamental principles such as the role            of regulatory capital and how it fits with broader economic            requirements for capital are

      Standard rules sovereign bonds issued in domestic currency carry a            zero risk weight. Under the IRC proposal such bonds are included in            scope and since charges are derived from CDS spreads these can be            non- zero. Although it is now accepted that no sovereign provides a            truly risk free rate, such instruments do not display jump to            default characteristics; rather the ratings migration is somewhat            steady. We do not think the standard rules should produce regulatory            capital charges which are lower than the IRC. Consistency may be            achieved through revision to standard rules, so that risk weights            for OECD sovereigns are better differentiated on a risk sensitive            basis.

      EBA agrees that consistency on sovereign bonds between standard            rules and the internal models approach (IMA) can be achieved through            revision of the standardized rules. However Basel 2.5 revisions did            not include revisions of the standardized rules and institutions            that are able to model IRC should also be able to include sovereign            risk into their IRC model. Competent authorities approving            institution's IRC models have been part of EBA discussions on the            content of the guidelines well before the draft guidelines for            public consultation were published and institutions have been made            aware of this requirement before receiving model approval from the            relevant competent authority.

When included in the            IRC, positions in defaulted debt may be excluded from the migration            element of the capital calculation if, given the specific model            framework of the institution, defaulted positions bear no migration            risk (for example if default is modelled as an absorbing state).            Institutions have to prove to the competent authorities if defaulted            debt is not material before they can exclude it.

      An issue arises in relation to the treatment of exposures to equity            positions. The draft Guidelines specify that `Notwithstanding the            inclusion in the IRC of positions in listed equity or in derivative            instruments based on listed equity, a specific risk capital charge            for these positions - capturing event risk in the case of the use of            an internal model - must still be calculated.' Clarification is            needed about the provision of a specific risk capital add-on for            such positions, given that its content is not clearly specified in            the text. If this sentence refers to the specific risk charge            already included in the internal model calculations, the reference            to such capital charge should be made more explicit. It is worth            mentioning that, following introduction of the IRC, all specific            risk surcharges have been removed.

Risk neutral PDs shall not be acceptable for the modelling of            the rating migration or default, so if PDs implied from market            prices are used, the bank should do the relevant corrections to            obtain the real measure probability from risk neutral probabilities,            and it should compare the outcomes of its methodology against the            historical record.

      The proposal pursuant to which at least one own migration matrix for            sovereign obligors will have to be developed does not take the lack            of relevant data into account. In our view, any estimation of such a            matrix is extremely instable; especially for the sub-investment            grade area this means that there is a strong reliance on isolated            rating changes. In our view there should only be a mandatory own            migration matrix if and when the available relevant data allows            their development in a meaningful manner. Furthermore the            consistency of this requirement is questioned due to two reasons 1)            Ratings are set based on an expected PD level, irrespective of the            region or sector. Looking back, however, migrations and defaults can            be concentrated in certain sectors or regions. Given that ratings            are set based on expected PD we think this would be better reflected            via correlations and/or a multi-factor model than via the ratings            and transition matrices. 2) The reliability of a separate

      The hypothesis that an institution will periodically roll-over its            positions may only be valid if the activity is on-going. Due to the            2008 crisis, several institutions have stopped some of their            activities, in particular in credit derivatives. In such cases, the            hypothesis that the institution will periodically roll-over its            positions is not valid and the portfolio will age naturally            (sometimes even more quickly as the institutions are managing the            book towards extinction). In the cases where portfolios are run into            extinction, national regulators should allow the institution to            assume the ageing of the book (therefore applying rule (18. 1.) with            a 1 year Liquidity horizon).

      EBA should consider modifying the guidance to a more conservative            approach of basing IRC on EL and UL losses as this would provide            more consistency with US. UL are used in IRB because a reserve is            taken on the banking book for EL. No such reserve is taken on the            trading book. The guideline should encourage institutions to take            into account the theta effect in their models and not prescribe the            modelling of UL as the only authorized way to achieve it.

      When an institution decides on an annual liquidity horizon for all            its positions, the notion of `maturity mismatches' is neither            coherent with the notion of `constant position assumption' mentioned            in 18.2 nor with the principles of 'instantaneous shocks' and `no            ageing of positions' detailed in 18.2 and 18.5.

     <p>
      Paragraph 19.4 especially applies when institutions explicitly model            ageing of positions, implying that the timing of default is            modelled. However, according to paragraph 18.5, the EBA does not            expect institutions to model ageing of positions at this stage. The            issue of maturity mismatches occurs only if liquidity horizons are            defined, as per wording in the CRD III / CRR. It is not an issue in            the case of a constant position assumption. We agree that a            liquidity horizon of one year for all positions is not different            from the constant position assumption over one year.

      When performing a full revaluation upon rating change, the current            CRD 3 would allow for discounting with spreads or with historical            PDs (as used for modelling rating migrations). We assume that the            section stating that 'The impact of a rating migration on market            prices may be estimated using either currently observed market data            (e.g. spreads); or an average of historical market data observed'            still allows for both choices. Under the provisions of CRD III,            during a complete revaluation after a rating change, spreads or            historic PDs may be discounted. We assume that this room for            discretion is also in line with the rationale behind this            consultation paper. To our preliminary understanding the option of            including `upswing estimates' means that such estimates should be            used during a foreseeable upswing. A potentially required            simultaneous computation of 'downturn' and `upswing' LGDs is not            feasible. As has been mentioned above, at present, institutes are            incapable of implementing these provisions which, besides, would            also lead to an inadequate risk picture.

      The EBA does not believe that historical PDs can be used for            discounting purposes when performing a full revaluation upon a            rating change. However, the institution may estimate the impact of            rating migration on market prices by using either current observed            market data or an average historical market data observed. The            relevant question in the context of `an average of historical data            observed' is how far back the observation period could reach. Over            one year seems not current enough to calculate a change in current            market price. Last sentence of para 20.4 regarding `appropriately            adjustment' has been deleted in the final guidelines to take into            account the comment.

One respondent agrees that in            estimating the impact of a rating migration on market prices firms            should be allowed to choose between using either currently observed            market data or an average of historical data observed and that as            long as they are able to justify their choice then national            regulators should not be super equivalent in imposing a particular            approach

      The preference to assign liquidity horizons on product/issuer level            is extremely granular and not in line with current practice which            looks at the liquidity of homogenous position classes grouped by            e.g. product type, issuer type, rating, concentration, etc. The            rationale behind the preference given to a liquidity horizon at the            level of product or issuers is not immediately obvious.

The disadvantages of choosing the liquidity          horizon at product level would be further compounded due to the fact          that the rating always depends on the issuer: Upon expiry of the          liquidity horizon, part of the positions of an issuer would see a          reset back to their original state and part of these positions would          not see such a reset.

We'd like to clarify that this requirement should            not be construed as a de facto requirement for a daily computation            of the IRC. This requirement should be satisfied by other means or            indicators.

      No daily computation of the IRC is required. This requirement can be            satisfied by other means. The key point of this provision is that            institutions should not chose a day with particularly lower risk            levels and which does not reflect the normal risk levels.

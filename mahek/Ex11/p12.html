    <p>
      The amendments to the Capital Requirements Directive1 by Directive
      2010/76/EU (CRD III)2 relate to the approach for capturing Incremental
      Default and Migration risks in the trading book, commonly referred to as
      the incremental risk capital charge (IRC). According to these amendments,
      the predecessor of the EBA, the Committee of European Banking Supervisors
      (CEBS)3 is tasked with monitoring the range of practices in this area and
      drawing up guidelines in order to secure a level playing field.
    </p>
    <p>
      The transposition by national supervisory authorities of the changes to
      the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) by Directive 2010/76/EU (CRD III)
      entered into force on 31 December2011.
    </p>
    <p>
      Providing guidance on the IRC modelling approaches employed by credit
      institutions using the Internal Model Approach (`IMA') for the calculation
      of the required capital for specific interest risk in the trading book, is
      seen as an important means of addressing weaknesses in the regulatory
      capital framework and in the risk management of financial institutions
      that contributed to the turmoil in global financial markets. The
      incremental risk charge is intended to complement additional standards
      being applied to the value-at-risk (VaR) modelling framework in the
      trading book and is expected to contribute to a more robust financial
      system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among other things, the first chapter of the Guidelines, 'Scope of
      Application' elaborates on the positions that are subject to IRC modelling
      and the permanent partial use of IRC models. The second chapter, on
      `Individual Modelling' provides guidance on the use and sources of
      individual parameters and ratings in IRC modelling. The third chapter, on
      'Interdependence' discusses i) the correlation between default and
      migration events, ii) copula assumptions, iii) systemic risk factors and
      iv) portfolio concentrations. Chapter four on `Migration matrices'
      elaborates on the use of transition matrices. Chapter five on the
      'Constant level of risk assumption over the one-year capital horizon'
      provides guidance on, among other issues, the use of liquidity horizons
      and the rebalancing of positions. Chapter six on 'Hedging' goes into more
      detail on the modelling of diversification effects. The seventh chapter,
      on 'P&amp;L valuation' elaborates on how ratings changes are turned into
      impact on market prices and on the computation of P&amp;L. Chapter eight
      on `Liquidity horizons' provides guidance on defining a liquidity horizon
      as well as on the key factors for determining the relevant liquidity
      horizon as well as on the monitoring of liquidity horizons. Chapter nine
      on 'Validation' elaborates on the validation process for IRC models.
      Chapter ten on 'Use tests' and chapter eleven, `Documentation' describe
      the minimum requirements for the use of IRC models and their related
      documentation. Chapter twelve on `IRC approaches based on different
      parameters' provides guidance on how to deal with IRC models that are `not

    <p>
      The Guidelines on the IRC are expected to contribute to a level playing
      field among credit institutions and to enhance convergence of supervisory
      practices among the competent authorities across the EU. It is expected
      that national competent authorities in the EU will implement the
      Guidelines by incorporating them within their supervisory procedures
      within six months after publication of the final guidelines. After that
      date, the competent authorities must ensure that institutions comply with
      the Guidelines effectively.

    <h2 role="sectionHeading">II. Background and Rationale</h2>
    <p>
      The agreement reached in July 20054 between the Basel Committee on Banking
      Supervision (BCBS) and the International Organisation of Securities
      Commissions (IOSCO), contained several improvements to the capital regime
      for trading book positions. Among these revisions was a new requirement
      for banks that model interest rate risk, to measure and hold capital
      against default risk that is incremental to any default risk captured in
      the bank's value-at-risk (VaR) model. The incremental default risk charge
      was incorporated into the trading book capital regime in response to the
      increasing amount of exposure in banks' trading books to credit risk,
      often related to illiquid products, whose risk is not reflected in the
      VaR.
    </p>
    <p>
      In October 2007, the BCBS released guidelines for computing capital for
      incremental default risk for public comment. At its meeting in March 2008,
      the Basel Committee reviewed comments received and decided to expand the
      scope of the capital charge. The decision was taken in light of the recent
      credit market turmoil where a number of major banking institutions had
      experienced large losses, most of which were sustained in the banks'
      trading books. Most of those losses were not captured in the 99%/10-day
      VaR. Since observed losses had not arisen from actual defaults, but rather
      from credit migrations combined with a widening of credit spreads and the
      loss of liquidity, applying an incremental risk charge covering default
      risk only, did not appear to besufficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      In January 2009, the BCBS proposed supplementing the current VaR-based
      trading book framework with, among other measures, an incremental risk
      capital charge (IRC), which covers default risk as well as migration risk
      for unsecuritised credit products and a stressed value-at-risk (Stressed
      VaR) requirement5.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the process of refining capital requirements for market risk, the BCBS
      conducted a quantitative impact study6. In summer 2009, the Trading Book
      Group of the BCBS (TBG) investigated the impact of the provisions of the
      BCBS 'Revisions to the Basel II market risk framework' and the `Guidelines
      for computing capital for incremental risk in the trading book'
      consultation papers published in January 2009, focusing (generally) on big
      internationally active banks with extensive trading activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The amendments to the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) by Directive
      2010/76/EU (CRD III)7 relating to the IRC in the trading book are a direct
      translation of the proposals from the BCBS.
    </p>
    <p>
      The European Banking Authority (EBA) is tasked with monitoring the range
      of practices in this area and to provide guidelines on the compliance of
      IRC modelling approaches with the CRD.

    <p>The objectives of the guidelines on the IRC are to:</p>

      The Guidelines presented in this paper do not aim to be a comprehensive
      set of rules, but rather to complement the new CRD provisions relating to
      the IRC where additional guidance was deemed necessary or appropriate by
      the EBA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given that the Guidelines discussed in this paper do not go beyond the
      provisions of the CRD but rather clarify how the rules are to be applied
      in practice, a detailed assessment of the costs and benefits associated
      with them is not required. These costs and benefits are unlikely to be
      incremental to those identified in the EU Commission's Impact Assessment
      accompanying its CRDIII proposal.

    <h2 role="sectionHeading">III. EBA Guidelines on the IRC</h2>
    <h3 role="sectionHeading">Status of these Guidelines</h3>
    <p>
      1. This document contains guidelines issued pursuant to Article 16 of
      Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council
      of 24 November 2010 establishing a European Supervisory Authority
      (European Banking Authority), amending Decision No 716/2009/EC and
      repealing Commission Decision 2009/78/EC ('the EBA Regulation'). In
      accordance with Article 16(3) of the EBA Regulation, competent authorities
      and financial market participants must make every effort to comply with
      the guidelines.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Guidelines set out the EBA's view of appropriate supervisory practices
      within the European System of Financial Supervision or of how Union law
      should be applied in a particular area. The EBA therefore expects all
      competent authorities and financial market participants to whom guidelines
      are addressed to comply. Competent authorities to whom guidelines apply
      should comply by incorporating them into their supervisory practices as
      appropriate (e.g. by amending their legal framework or their supervisory
      rules and/or guidance or supervisory processes), including where
      particular guidelines are directed primarily at institutions.
    </p>
    <h3 role="sectionHeading">Notification Requirements</h3>
    <p>
      3. According to Article 16(3) of the EBA Regulation, competent authorities
      must notify the EBA as to whether they comply or intend to comply with
      these guidelines, or otherwise with reasons for non-compliance, by
      16.07.2012. In the absence of any notification by this deadline, competent
      authorities will be considered by the EBA as non-compliant. Notifications
      should be sent by submitting the form provided at Section V to
      compliance@eba.europa.eu with the reference 'EBA/GL/2012/3'. Notifications
      should be submitted by persons with appropriate authority to report
      compliance on behalf of their competent authorities.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The notification of competent authorities mentioned in the previous
      paragraph shall be published on the EBA website, as per article 16 of EBA
      Regulation.

    <h1 role="title">Title I - Subject matter, Scope and Definitions</h1>
    <h4 role="sectionHeading">1. Subject matter</h4>
    <p>
      These guidelines aim at achieving a common understanding among the
      competent authorities across the EU on IRC modelling in order to
      contribute to a level playing field in line with Annex V of Directive
      2006/49/EC, as amended by Directive 2010/76/EU.
    </p>
    <p><b>2. Institutional scope and level of application</b></p>
    <p>
      1. Competent authorities should require the institutions mentioned in
      paragraph 2 below to comply with the provisions laid down in these
      Guidelines on IRC.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. These Guidelines should apply to institutions using an Internal Model
      Approach (IMA) for the purpose of calculating the capital requirements for
      specific interest risk in the trading book.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The guidelines apply to institutions at the level (solo and/or
      consolidated) on which the relevant internal model is authorised to be
      used by the relevant competent authority, unless stated otherwise in these
      Guidelines.
    </p>
    <h4 role="sectionHeading">3. Definitions</h4>
    <p>In these guidelines the following definitions should apply:</p>
    <ul level="1">
      <li>
        <p>
          a. The term <i>institutions</i> should mean credit institutions and
          investment firms as set out in Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          b. The term <i>permanent partial use</i> in point 8 of these
          Guidelines, should mean that certain positions, which are excluded
          from specific risk VaR and from the application of the IRC, based on
          Annex V, point 6 of Directive 2006/49/EC, are subject to the
          standardised approach for specific interest rate risk.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Title II - Requirements regarding institutions' IRC modelling</p>
    <h3 role="sectionHeading">A. Material scope of application</h3>
    <p><b>4. Positions subject to calculation of the IRC</b></p>
    <p>
      1. Calculation of the IRC should include all long and short positions
      subject to a modelled charge for specific interest rate risk, with the
      exception of the items referred to at point 5 below.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. In particular, the following positions should be included, if they are
      part of the trading book:
    </p>
    <aside><p role="pageNumber">9</p></aside>
    <p>
      i. bonds issued by central governments ("sovereigns"), even in cases where
      the application of the standardised approach would result in a 0 % risk
      charge for specific interest rate risk;
    </p>
    <p>
      ii. structured bonds, credit linked notes or similar debt instruments if
      they do not embed exposures to securitisations or n-th-to-default credit
      derivatives;
    </p>
    <p>iii. money market loans.</p>
    <p>
      3. Positions resulting from the application of the look-through approach
      to the shares of collective undertakings (CIUs), when such positions, if
      they directly belonged to the trading book, would be included in the
      calculation of the IRC according to point 4.1 above, should also be
      included. When the application of the look-through approach to the shares
      of CIUs is not possible, the standardised approach should be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The following positions are not considered securitisations and should
      therefore be included in the calculation of IRC, if they are part of the
      trading book:
    </p>
    <ul level="1">
      <li>
        <p>
          a. covered bonds (e.g. `Pfandbriefe') since such bonds are simply
          collateralised and not asset-backed;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          b. asset-backed securities that do not meet the definition of
          'securitisation position' in Article 3(1)(f) of Directive 2006/49/EC,
          which refers to Article 4(36) of Directive 2006/48/EC. For example
          where cash flows from the underlying pool are allocated to securities
          holders on a pro-rata basis and therefore have no tranching (e.g.
          pass-through MBS).
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      5. Positions in defaulted debt held in the trading book should, where
      material, be included in the calculation of the IRC. In this case, they
      may be excluded from the migration element of the IRC if, given the
      specific model framework of the institution, defaulted positions bear no
      migration risk (for example if default is modelled as an absorbing state).
      Where these positions are excluded for materiality reasons, an institution
      must be able to demonstrate that they are not material. In all cases, any
      material risk of price changes of defaulted debt, as driven by uncertain
      recovery marks, should be capitalised.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The definition of default in the case of paragraph 5 above, should be
      consistent with the definition of default in ratings used for modelling
      purposes.
    </p>
    <p><b>5. Positions not subject to calculation of the IRC</b></p>
    <p>
      The following items should be excluded from the calculation of the IRC:
    </p>
    <ul level="1">
      <li><p>a. securitisations;</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>b. n-th-to-default credit derivatives; and</p>
        <ul level="2">
          <li>
            <p>
              c. positions subject to the specific interest rate risk charge and
              different from securitisations or n-th-to-default credit
              derivatives if they are positions of the correlation trading
              portfolio (CTP).
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <aside><p role="pageNumber">10</p></aside>
    <p><b>6. Positions in equity and equity derivatives</b></p>
    <p>
      1. Competent authorities may allow the inclusion in the IRC of listed
      equity positions and derivatives positions based on listed equity subject
      to the following conditions:
    </p>
    <ul level="1">
      <li>
        <p>
          i. the related positions in equity and credit instruments are jointly
          managed by an identified trading unit (e.g. arbitrage between
          convertible bonds and equity);
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      ii. procedures for the measurement and management of joint credit and
      equity risk are in place for the relevant trading unit; and
    </p>
    <ul level="1">
      <li>
        <p>
          i. all equity positions of the relevant trading unit are included, in
          order to avoid cherry-picking.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      2. If a listed equity or a derivative instrument based on listed equity is
      included in the computation of the IRC measure, the default of any of
      these instruments is deemed to occur if the related debt defaults.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Notwithstanding the inclusion in the IRC of positions in listed equity
      or in derivative instruments based on listed equity, a specific risk
      capital charge for these positions - capturing event risk in the case of
      the use of an internal model - must still be calculated.
    </p>
    <p><b>7. Positions in the institution's own debt</b></p>
    <p>
      1. Long positions in the institution's own debt, which may arise from
      trading or market-making activity in its own bonds, should be included
      within the scope of the IRC model but only migration risk should be taken
      into account for the calculation of the charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Short positions in the institution's own debt, which may arise from the
      inclusion in the trading book of own-debt issues (e.g. structured bonds or
      money market trades) or from buying protection on the institution's own
      name (e.g. via an index) should be included within the scope of the IRC
      model but only migration risk should be taken into account for the
      calculation of the charge. The default risk of short positions in own debt
      should not be modelled in the IRC approach.
    </p>
    <aside><p role="pageNumber">11</p></aside>
    <h3 role="sectionHeading">8. Permanent partial use</h3>
    <p>
      1. Where use is made of the provisions of the CRD on the permanent partial
      use, the rationale for this should be carefully documented and analysed to
      show it is not intended to deliver a charge that is less conservative than
      if all positions were within the specific risk VaR and the IRC model.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Permanent partial use of the IRC should not apply to sovereign bonds
      and derivative products referencing sovereign bonds since - from a
      modelling point of view - the inclusion of these positions in the specific
      risk model and consequently in the IRC framework is not considered to be
      particularly challenging.
    </p>
    <h2 role="sectionHeading">B. Individual Modelling</h2>
    <h3 role="sectionHeading">9. Soundness standard comparable to IRB</h3>
    <p>
      Unless otherwise specified in these guidelines, the soundness standard
      comparable to IRB applicable to IRC is: a capital horizon of 1 year and a
      confidence interval of 99.9 %.
    </p>
    <h3 role="sectionHeading">10. Qualitative criteria</h3>
    <p>
      All aspects of the IRC approach applied should be thoroughly documented.
      This includes documentation of any analysis undertaken to motivate
      assumptions, estimation techniques, proxies, or simplifications. Any such
      decisions should be justified at the request of the competent authority.
    </p>
    <h3 role="sectionHeading">11. Source of ratings</h3>
    <p>
      1. Institutions' IRC approaches may rely on either internal or external
      ratings. Internal ratings used for IRC purposes should be consistent with
      how they are derived in the IRB approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Institutions should have procedures in place for inferring a rating for
      non-rated positions. When credit spreads are available, their use for
      inferring a rating should be clearly documented. Likewise, the use of a
      default rating (i.e. a `fall-back' rating for positions where no
      observable data can be used to infer a rating) should be documented. Any
      rating system applied should, as far as possible, differentiate between
      relevant groups of positions.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. An institution should have in place a documented hierarchy of sources
      of ratings for determining the rating of an individual position. If an
      institution uses different sources of ratings (e.g. internal and external
      ratings or different external rating
    </p>
    <aside><p role="pageNumber">12</p></aside>
    <p>
      agencies' estimates), it should consistently map the ratings into a common
      Masterscale.
    </p>
    <h3 role="sectionHeading">12. Source of PDs and LGDs</h3>
    <p>
      1. Where an institution has approved PD estimates or PD and LGD, estimates
      as part of the internal ratings based approach (IRBA) set out in Article
      84 of directive 2006/48/EC, this data may be used as a source for
      obtaining PD and LGD estimates for IRC purposes, as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Where , in the latter cases, an institution does not have approved IRB
      PDs and/or LGDs or where IRB PDs and/or LGDs do not exist for an issuer or
      a security in the trading book, these should be computed using a
      methodology consistent with the IRB methodology, which would then require
      a separate approval by the competent authority for use in the IRC.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Risk neutral PDs should not be acceptable as estimates of observed
      (historical) PDs for the modelling of the rating migration or default. If
      PDs implied from market prices are used, the institution should do the
      relevant corrections to obtain the real measure probability from risk
      neutral probabilities, and it should compare the outcomes of its
      methodology against the historical record.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Alternatively, the use of PDs and LGDs provided by external sources
      (e.g. rating agencies) may also be used by institutions, as they are
      generally considered appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Institutions should establish a hierarchy ranking their preferred
      sources for their PDs and LGDs, in order to avoid the cherry-picking of
      parameters.
    </p>
    <h2 role="sectionHeading">C. Interdependence</h2>
    <h3 role="sectionHeading">
      13. Correlations between default and migration events
    </h3>
    <p>
      Institutions' IRC models should include the impact of correlations between
      default or migration events in a way that is consistent with their
      purpose, which is to capture credit risk correlations between different
      issuers. The assumptions on which their estimation is based should be
      consistent with the assumptions used in the simulation. The methodology
      should be documented and duly justified. The approach should be adequate
      and conservative enough to capture the interdependence between the risk
      drivers of credit risk events such as defaults and migrations. This would
      include, for example, the obligation that, if institutions choose to
      estimate their correlation parameters from the prices of traded
      securities, the estimates should be updated frequently.
    </p>
    <aside><p role="pageNumber">13</p></aside>
    <h3 role="sectionHeading">14. Copula assumptions</h3>
    <p>
      For the purposes of describing its assumptions on the interdependence
      between risk factors, an institution may select possible copula candidates
      according to its ability to explain default or migration clusters for
      historical tail events. The choice of a particular copula should be
      justified and documented.
    </p>
    <h3 role="sectionHeading">15. Systemic risk factors</h3>
    <p>
      1. Although interdependence between issuers is frequently modelled in a
      similar way to the regulatory IRB framework, using a combination of an
      idiosyncratic (i.e. individual) and one or more systemic risk factors, no
      modelling approach is prescribed by these Guidelines, provided that an
      institution meets all the relevant qualitative and validation requirements
      to ensure that its approach is suitably conservative.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. If the model assumes different liquidity horizons, the evolution of
      systemic risk factors should be consistent and compatible across these
      different liquidity horizons.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The correlation between systemic risk factor(s) and individual issuer's
      `ability-to- pay process' may be difficult to estimate because they are
      not directly observable. Any estimation technique based directly or
      indirectly on observable market data (as in the case of listed equity)
      should be duly justified and documented.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Where an institution chooses a parametric formula assuming multiple
      systemic risk factors, thus better reflecting industry or regional
      concentration than when assuming a unique systemic risk factor, the choice
      of the parametric formula should be analysed and validated, for example by
      comparing the results of the current model with the outcome of a modified
      version of the same model that uses the IRB formula and where all systemic
      risk factors are perfectly correlated.
    </p>
    <h3 role="sectionHeading">16. Portfolio concentration</h3>
    <p>
      1. Institutions' IRC models should reflect issuer concentrations, which,
      for example, may arise from a lack of regional or industry diversification
      or from large exposures to individual or connected issuers. Institutions
      should evidence the overall appropriate capture of issuer concentration
      risks within the IRC. To this purpose, institutions should validate and
      document notably, but not only, that the IRC model result increases with
      the level of concentration of their portfolio.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. An institution has to prove specifically that its approach captures
      portfolio concentrations appropriately.
    </p>
    <aside><p role="pageNumber">14</p></aside>
    <h3 role="sectionHeading">17. Migration matrices</h3>
    <p>
      1. Transition matrices for modelling the rating migration process should
      be based on historical migration data using either external sources (i.e.
      rating agencies) or internal sources. Matrices from external sources
      should be preferred in cases where internal historical data is sparse.
      Institutions should ensure that the amount of historical data is
      sufficient to derive robust, accurate and statistically consistent
      estimates. Institutions should validate the robustness of transition
      matrices particularly in relation to higher rating categories, where a few
      severe downgrades or defaults can affect the migration frequency
      significantly. In accordance with the requirement for a `standard of
      soundness comparable to IRB' which the CRD establishes, a minimum
      historical observation period of 5 years is required.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Separate transition matrices may be applied for specific groups of
      issuers and specific geographical areas. Depending on (i) the composition
      of the institutions' portfolio, (ii) the availability of accurate
      transition matrices and (iii) possible differences in migration
      characteristics across products, issuers and/or geographical areas, a
      balanced decision should be made on the set of transition matrices used.
      Such a decision should consider (i) the choice of the (internal or
      external) source in combination with an analysis of the overlap and/or
      possible mismatch between the institutions' portfolio and the assets
      underlying the transition matrix; (ii) the motivation for any weighting
      scheme (also for the use of equal weights); and (iii) the size of the
      historical window. Institutions should develop one (or more when relevant
      data is available) transition matrix that is specific to sovereign
      obligors.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. When default is modelled as an absorbing state, transition matrices
      should be adjusted to ensure that this absorbing state does not conflict
      with internal PD estimates. Similarly, transition matrices where `NR'
      (`Not rated') or another column is an absorbing state for withdrawn
      ratings or non-rated exposures can be adjusted. Any such adjustments
      should be documented, and the impact of the specified adjustment should be
      included as part of the documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Transition matrices, in general, relate to a one-year horizon. Where
      shorter horizon matrices are required, which is the case when liquidity
      horizons shorter than one year are used, the corresponding transition
      matrices cannot always be computed directly and approximations are
      required. Both the approximations and the motivation for specific
      assumptions applied in this process should be documented (e.g. when
      generator matrices are used). These assumptions should also be assessed in
      order to verify that they remain valid over time. As part of the
      validation process a matrix based on a generator could be calculated for a
      horizon identical to the originating matrix's horizon in order to assess
      the difference resulting from the process of developing the generator
      matrix.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b
        >18. Constant level of risk assumption over the one-year capital
        horizon</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      1. When modelling a constant level of risk over the one-year capital
      horizon, institutions should rebalance or roll-over positions at the end
      of each liquidity
    </p>
    <aside><p role="pageNumber">15</p></aside>
    <p>
      horizon to new positions, so as to ensure the same initial level of risk
      as at the start of the liquidity horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. When assuming a one-year constant position, which implies not adopting
      liquidity horizons, institutions should consistently apply to all IRC
      positions an instantaneous shock over the one-year capital horizon
      (referred to as `one-year constant position assumption').
    </p>
    <p>
      3. From a modelling perspective, the constant level of risk may be
      reflected as the replacement of positions, if a migration or a default has
      occurred over the liquidity horizon, with positions that have risk
      characteristics equivalent to those of the original positions at the start
      of the liquidity horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Modelling a constant level of risk over the one-year capital horizon
      may be achieved, for example, on the basis of the approach outlined
      hereafter. With respect to calculating losses over liquidity horizons, an
      institution may choose to assume that instantaneous shocks are applied to
      ratings (or spreads). This implies that, in this case, the institution
      does not have to integrate the time effect: positions keep their original
      residual maturities at the end of each liquidity horizon; in other words,
      there is no ageing of positions. Furthermore, there is no need to consider
      potential changes in market conditions when revaluating the portfolio at
      the time of rebalancing (in particular, credit spreads by rating can be
      kept constant). As a result, measurement of losses within IRC does not
      take into account the timing of each migration or default event, and the
      P&amp;L is computed as of today.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Modelling the ageing of positions should not be allowed in IRC
      modelling, given the expected tremendous challenges and the observed
      difficulties associated with modelling the ageing of positions, together
      with the substantial regulatory arbitrage this could result in. This
      justifies that, at the present stage, a conservative approach is
      preferred.
    </p>
    <h3 role="sectionHeading">19. Hedging</h3>
    <p>
      1. For the purpose of calculating the IRC, institutions may net long and
      short positions only when they refer to strictly identical financial
      instruments.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Diversification effects associated with long and short positions may
      only be recognised by explicitly modelling gross long and short positions
      in the different instruments. In any case, institutions should demonstrate
      that diversification or hedging effects are not overestimated; in
      particular maturity mismatches should be reflected in models.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. In order to reflect basis risk appropriately, where this risk is
      material, valuation for the purposes of the IRC for related positions
      (like, for example, bonds and CDSs
    </p>
    <aside><p role="pageNumber">16</p></aside>
    <p>
      on the same obligor) should be differentiated. Thus, net long and net
      short positions that reference similar - but not identical - underlying
      assets should not result in an IRC measure equal to zero. Where basis risk
      is not accounted for, institutions should provide proof that this risk is
      not material.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Institutions should reflect the impact within the liquidity horizon of
      maturity mismatches between long and short positions (for example if a CDS
      matures before the underlying bond and the default happens after the CDS
      maturity), if the resulting risks are material. Therefore, an institution
      should be able to compute the P&amp;L taking into account the impact of
      potential maturity mismatches between long and short positions. An
      institution should at least be able to prove that the above- mentioned
      risk is not a material risk, otherwise it should have to model the risk
      accordingly.
    </p>
    <h2 role="sectionHeading">D. P&amp;L valuation</h2>
    <h3 role="sectionHeading">20. Impact of rating change on market prices</h3>
    <p>
      1. Institutions may choose any of the approaches available to convert
      simulated rating variations into price variations, including using either
      absolute or relative differences between average spreads by rating class.
      The methodology used should be consistently applied and documented. In all
      cases, the relevant spread data should be as differentiated as possible
      according to the different categories of positions. The approach should be
      shown to differentiate sufficiently between positions with different
      pricing characteristics to the satisfaction of the competent authorities.
      For example, a credit default swap (CDS) and the underlying bond would
      have to be valued separately.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. With regard to point 18 of these Guidelines, an institution may
      consistently assume an instantaneous rating change, implying that market
      conditions at the time determine prices after migration, taking into
      account any idiosyncratic valuation impact that would be expected when a
      migration event occurs (see point 20.5 below), ignoring all time effects
      on the price of an instrument whose rating changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. If a simulation, e.g. the asset value process, has not resulted in a
      changed rating, no change in value should be assumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. In the case of a rating migration, the variation of market prices
      should be recalculated. Full revaluation should be required unless an
      institution can prove that its pricing approach sufficiently reflects even
      the large price changes that are to be expected from a change in rating.
      This may be done as a pre-calculation in the sense that a vector of prices
      for each rating state might be an input in an IRC calculation. The impact
      of a rating migration on market prices should be estimated using either
      currently observed market data (e.g. spreads); or an average of historical
      market data observed over a maximum period of one year or any other
      relevant period
    </p>
    <aside><p role="pageNumber">17</p></aside>
    <p>
      subject to approval by competent authorities. Historical PDs should not be
      used for discounting purposes when performing a full revaluation upon a
      rating change as they do not sufficiently reflect current market prices.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Positions migrating into the default state should be valued on the
      basis of the recovery rate or the loss given default rate. The recovery
      rate should be applied to the notional value of the position unless the
      estimates are derived relative to the market values of positions. It has
      to be shown to the satisfaction of the competent authorities that the
      estimate is appropriately differentiated for different categories of
      obligors and instruments. Calculations should be coherent between
      instruments. Any other approach should be duly justified and documented,
      in particular if generic market LGDs are used, and the institution should
      have a documented process in place describing on which criteria LGDs for
      individual positions are to be adjusted.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The model should capture divergences arising from differences in credit
      event definition, seniority in the capital structure or exposure to
      different entities within a group. This could, for example, be implemented
      through the use of stochastic recovery rates. Defaulted bonds are in
      principle included in the IRC portfolio if they are in the trading book
      (cf. Paragraph 4.5). Therefore, the model should capture the risk that
      post-default LGD marks or realisations may diverge from their pre-default
      estimates. The initial LGD or recovery rate applied to individual
      defaulted positions would have to be updated with the same frequency for
      the IRC as for the P&amp;L calculation and the LGDs must be in line with
      the numbers used for the P&amp;L calculation.
    </p>
    <h3 role="sectionHeading">21. Computation of P&amp;L</h3>
    <p>
      The valuation parameters for all rating categories should be estimated in
      a methodologically consistent way. Since the IRC is a capital requirement
      for market risks, the valuation of positions under the IRC should be based
      on currently observable market data. Market data used to evaluate the
      positions to which the shocks generated by the rating migration are
      applied should be the latest available market data at the time of
      computation of the IRC.
    </p>
    <h2 role="sectionHeading">E. Liquidity horizon</h2>
    <p><b>22. The level at which to define liquidity horizons</b></p>
    <p>
      1. Institutions should define liquidity horizons at a product level rather
      than on an issuer level. For an individual position the relevant liquidity
      horizon may vary according to the type of product (including its
      complexity), and the issuer.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Nevertheless, given the practical issues with an entirely granular
      assessment of liquidity horizon at a product level, considering the
      significant range of products held
    </p>
    <aside><p role="pageNumber">18</p></aside>
    <p>
      in trading portfolios, liquidity horizons may be initially defined on an
      aggregated basis, for example at the issuer level.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Institutions should, however, monitor and document the range of
      products linked to each issuer and ensure that the liquidity horizon
      defined at an aggregate level is adequate for even the most illiquid
      product.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>23. Key criteria for determining the relevant liquidity horizon</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Institutions should document the criteria used in the determination of
      the relevant liquidity horizon for a position or set of positions. The
      methodology for converting those criteria into a defined liquidity horizon
      should also be documented and applied consistently for all positions.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. A wide range of criteria can indicate the liquidity of a position,
      based on past experience, market structure, and the quality or complexity
      of the product. Institutions should identify a range of criteria that they
      believe materially define the liquidity horizon of their portfolios. These
      criteria include:
    </p>
    <ul level="1">
      <li>
        <p>
          i. Market activity, as reflected in number and volume of trades in an
          instrument or name, or in the size of historical bid-offer spreads;
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      ii. Market structure, such as the number and distribution of market makers
      and quotes;
    </p>
    <p>
      iii. Size of position (relative to average trading volumes/overall market
      size);
    </p>
    <p>v. Investment quality (e.g. credit rating);</p>
    <p>v. Geographical location of issuer;</p>
    <p>vi. Maturity.</p>
    <p>
      3. At least one of the criteria considered in the determination of a
      liquidity horizon should be directly linked to the concentrated nature of
      positions (for example, through the size of position relative to the
      market size or average trading volumes), given that the liquidity horizon
      is expected to be greater for positions that are concentrated, reflecting
      the longer period needed to liquidate such positions.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Positions should be systematically assessed against the criteria chosen
      and allocated to liquidity horizons accordingly (with a floor of 3
      months). Where limited data is available on a position or set of
      positions, institutions should be conservative in determining the relevant
      liquidity horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The approach applied to link a criterion to a longer or shorter
      liquidity horizon should be documented and supported by historical
      evidence including evidence based on experience of liquidating similar
      positions during stressed periods, to ensure that assumptions which appear
      theoretically logical but are not true in practice are not mistakenly used
      in the analysis - for example it may not be true in
    </p>
    <aside><p role="pageNumber">19</p></aside>
    <p>
      all cases that a lower credit rating implies a longer liquidity horizon if
      there is an active market in certain types of positions with low credit
      ratings. For example, in the case of the use of historical bid-offer
      spreads, institutions may set thresholds which determine which liquidity
      horizon a position is allocated to - the choice of these thresholds should
      be justified.
    </p>
    <h3 role="sectionHeading">
      24. Monitoring liquidity horizons - key indicators of the need for review
    </h3>
    <p>
      1. Liquidity horizons should be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure they
      remain appropriate, particularly in relation to events or any significant
      indicators that liquidity conditions have changed in a market, reflecting
      the possibility for the liquidity of markets to change rapidly as market
      participants enter and exit asset classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Institutions should consider significant changes in the factors used to
      determine the liquidity horizon as a minimum set of triggers for a review
      of the relevant liquidity horizon. Any experience of selling a position
      that indicates a liquidity horizon is not sufficiently conservative should
      also immediately be taken into account in determining the liquidity
      horizon for similar products and the procedures for allocating positions
      to liquidity factors should then be updated accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Over time institutions should monitor and enhance the range of factors
      used to identify liquidity horizons based on their market experience.
    </p>
    <h2 role="sectionHeading">F. General matters</h2>
    <h3 role="sectionHeading">25. Validation</h3>
    <p>
      1. Institutions should apply the validation principles in designing,
      testing and maintaining IRC models. Validation should include evaluation
      of conceptual soundness, on-going monitoring that covers process
      verification and benchmarking, and outcomes analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The validation process of IRC models should include at least the
      following principles:
    </p>
    <ul level="1">
      <li>
        <p>
          i. Liquidity horizons should reflect actual practice and experience
          during periods of both systematic and idiosyncratic stresses;
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      ii. The IRC model for measuring default and migration risk over the
      liquidity horizon should take into account objective data over the
      relevant horizon and include a comparison of risk estimates for a
      rebalanced portfolio with that of a portfolio with fixed positions;
    </p>
    <p>
      iii. The correlation assumptions in the IRC model, including the structure
      of stochastic dependencies and correlations/copulas, as well as the number
      and weight of systematic risk factors, must be supported by analysis of
    </p>
    <aside><p role="pageNumber">20</p></aside>
    <p>
      objective data in a conceptually sound framework. In particular, the
      impact of different copula assumptions should be analysed, for example by
      testing the impact of different distributional assumptions. The default
      and migration behaviour predicted by the model should be validated against
      actual default and migration experience of traded debt portfolios.
    </p>
    <p>
      iv. The validation of an IRC model should rely on a variety of stress
      tests and sensitivity and scenario analyses, to assess its qualitative and
      quantitative reasonableness, particularly with regard to the model's
      treatment of concentration. Such a test should cover both historical and
      hypothetical events;
    </p>
    <p>
      v. The validation should also cover the assessment of calibration of PD
      and LGD risk parameters;
    </p>
    <p>
      vi. An institution should strive to develop relevant internal modelling
      benchmarks to assess the overall accuracy of its IRC models;
    </p>
    <p>
      vii. The validation should assess the transparency and adequacy of
      documentation of the IRC modelling approach.
    </p>
    <h3 role="sectionHeading">26. Use Test</h3>
    <p>
      1. An institution should document how the IRC process is reported
      internally, its resulting risk-measurement judgements and the role these
      judgements play in the (risk) management of the institution.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The procedures that, given the judgement of the IRC, lead to potential
      appropriate corrective action should be in place and well embedded within
      risk management.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. A comparison of the ways internal market risk model outputs are
      reported, judged, audited and used internally by specific departments
      within the institution is considered a helpful way to clarify the use
      test.
    </p>
    <p><b>27. Documentation</b></p>
    <p>
      1. An institution should document its approach to capturing incremental
      default and migration risks so that its correlation and other modelling
      assumptions are transparent to the competent authorities.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Therefore, the calculation of the risk measures generated by the model
      and the associated data flows should be documented to a level of detail
      that would allow a third party to replicate these risk measures.
      Furthermore, the institution should document the process for initial and
      ongoing validation of the IRC model to a level of detail that would enable
      a third party to replicate the analysis. This documentation should also
      contain a description of the ongoing model maintenance processes as
      employed in the course of the initial assignment and update of model input
      parameters.
    </p>
    <aside><p role="pageNumber">21</p></aside>
    <p><b>28. IRC approaches based on different parameters</b></p>
    <p>
      1. An institution may use an approach to capturing incremental default and
      migration risks that does not comply with all the provisions of Annex II
      Paragraph 3 of Directive 2010/76/EU (referred to as a `not fully compliant
      IRC approach' in the remainder of this section):
    </p>
    <ul level="1">
      <li>
        <p>
          i. when this not fully compliant IRC approach is consistent with the
          institution's internal methodologies for identifying, measuring and
          managing risks;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          ii. and when the institution is able to demonstrate that its approach
          results in a capital requirement that is at least as high as if it was
          based on an approach in full compliance with all IRC requirements.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      2. The institution should provide all necessary information concerning
      elements of the institution's IRC approach that are considered, either by
      the institution or by its supervisor, as not fully compliant.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. On the basis of the information provided, the competent national
      supervisor should decide whether the IRC approach used - or planned to be
      used - by the institution should be considered as a non-compliant IRC
      approach or could be considered as a non-fully compliant IRC approach
      according to point 28.4 below. In particular, if an IRC approach is
      recognised as a non-compliant IRC approach, this would in principle entail
      the application of the standardised approach for specific risk to the
      positions covered by the non-compliant IRC approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. In order to have its approach recognised as a non-fully compliant IRC
      approach, an institution should demonstrate, to the satisfaction of its
      supervisor, that the institution's IRC approach results in a capital
      requirement that is at least as high as if it were based on a fully
      compliant IRC approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The decision to recognise an institution's approach as a non-fully
      compliant approach is made by competent authorities.
    </p>
    <h4 role="sectionHeading">29. Frequency of calculation</h4>
    <p>
      1. Calculation of the IRC should be at least weekly. However, institutions
      can choose to compute the measure more frequently. If, for example, an
      institution decides on a weekly IRC computation, for the daily calculation
      of capital requirements based on internal models the following should
      apply:
    </p>
    <ul level="4">
      <li>
        <p>
          i. The same IRC number should be used for five subsequent business
          days following the running of the IRC model;
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul level="3">
      <li>
        <p>
          ii. With respect to the calculation of the average IRC numbers on the
          preceding 12 weeks, institutions should use the previous twelve IRC
          weekly numbers to compute that average.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <aside><p role="pageNumber">22</p></aside>
    <p>
      2. The institution should be able to prove that, on the day of the week
      chosen for the IRC calculation, its portfolio is representative of the
      portfolio held during the week and that the chosen portfolio does not lead
      to a systematic underestimation of the IRC numbers when computed weekly.

      1. The European Banking Authority (EBA) officially came into being on 1
      January 2011 and has taken over all existing and ongoing tasks and
      responsibilities from the Committee of European Banking Supervisors
      (CEBS).
    </p>
    <p>
      2. On 16 November 2011, the draft Guidelines on the Incremental Default
      and Migration Risk Charge (IRC) were presented to the EBA's Banking
      Stakeholder Group (BSG). The BSG provided broad comments and suggestions,
      to be considered by the EBA, when finalizing the Guidelines8.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. On 30 November 2011, the EBA submitted the draft Guidelines on IRC for
      public consultation. The consultation period ended on 15 January 2012. Ten
      responses were received9. In addition, a public hearing was held on 13
      December 2011 at the EBA's premises in London, to allow interested parties
      to share their views with the EBA.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The responses to the consultation paper were generally positive and
      supportive of EBA's work and required only some clarification; however, on
      some paragraphs in the consultation paper, the majority of the respondents
      disagreed or requested significant clarification.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. A detailed account of the comments received and the EBA's responses to
      them is provided in the feedback table below. The feedback table is
      divided between general remarks and specific comments received from
      respondents and includes a section with EBA's point of view on them and
      the changes made in the final guidelines to address them.

    <p>
      6. In some cases, several respondents made similar comments. In such
      cases, the comments, and EBA's analysis of them are included in the

            already submitted detailed model documentation for approval and

            The timing for making the model changes remains unclear: we
            understand that the EBA will issue final guidance late in the first
            quarter of 2012 and that there will then be a six month period in
            which the guidance will be transposed into national requirements at
            which point banks would have to be compliant. If so the timetable is
            too short to implement any potential model changes.

            Indeed, as mentioned in the guidelines the EBA expects that
            competent authorities will implement the guidelines within six
            months after publication of the final version. Indirectly this means
            that EBA expects institutions to comply with the guidelines as soon
            as they are implemented by the competent authorities in their
            supervisory practices, but in any case within six months after
            publication of the final guidelines. The EBA believes sufficient
            time is given to competent authorities and institutions to implement
            the guidelines.

            The issue of whether to use Through The Cycle or Point in Time
            probabilities centres on an important issue around the role of
            capital which has been raised in the Fundamental Review feedback
            from industry (principle 8). For wind-up capital, which we refer to
            as Level 1 capital, PiT probabilities are probably more appropriate.
            However for Level 2 capital, which we associate with going concern
            capital, TTC probabilities are arguably more appropriate. This
            remains a matter for debate however; the important point here is
            that consistency is needed from regulators (principle 6) and this
            will only be possible when fundamental principles such as the role
            of regulatory capital and how it fits with broader economic

            Standard rules sovereign bonds issued in domestic currency carry a
            zero risk weight. Under the IRC proposal such bonds are included in
            scope and since charges are derived from CDS spreads these can be
            non- zero. Although it is now accepted that no sovereign provides a
            truly risk free rate, such instruments do not display jump to
            default characteristics; rather the ratings migration is somewhat
            steady. We do not think the standard rules should produce regulatory
            capital charges which are lower than the IRC. Consistency may be
            achieved through revision to standard rules, so that risk weights
            for OECD sovereigns are better differentiated on a risk sensitive
            basis.

            for these positions - capturing event risk in the case of the use of
            an internal model - must still be calculated.' Clarification is

            such positions, given that its content is not clearly specified in

            included within the scope of the IRC model. The present consultation
            paper, however, requests that own issues be taken into account
            during migrations, but not during default. If the current proposals
            were to be adopted, this re-interpretation would engender further
            model adjustments yet again. We kindly request a clarification why
            own issues shall now be included within the scope of the IRC model.
            Confirmation is required that the absence, among the examples of
            long positions in the institution's own debt, of positions arising
            from selling protection on the institution's own name is a mere
            oversight. We would find beneficial having a clarification of the
            rationale for explicitly mentioning credit index exposures among the

            The proposal pursuant to which at least one own migration matrix for
            sovereign obligors will have to be developed does not take the lack
            of relevant data into account. In our view, any estimation of such a
            matrix is extremely instable; especially for the sub-investment
            grade area this means that there is a strong reliance on isolated
            rating changes. In our view there should only be a mandatory own
            migration matrix if and when the available relevant data allows
            their development in a meaningful manner. Furthermore the
            consistency of this requirement is questioned due to two reasons 1)
            Ratings are set based on an expected PD level, irrespective of the
            region or sector. Looking back, however, migrations and defaults can
            be concentrated in certain sectors or regions. Given that ratings
            are set based on expected PD we think this would be better reflected
            via correlations and/or a multi-factor model than via the ratings
            and transition matrices. 2) The reliability of a separate

            When an institution decides on an annual liquidity horizon for all

            coherent with the notion of `constant position assumption' mentioned

            Paragraph 19.4 especially applies when institutions explicitly model

            modelled. However, according to paragraph 18.5, the EBA does not
            expect institutions to model ageing of positions at this stage. The
            issue of maturity mismatches occurs only if liquidity horizons are
            defined, as per wording in the CRD III / CRR. It is not an issue in
            the case of a constant position assumption. We agree that a
            liquidity horizon of one year for all positions is not different
            from the constant position assumption over one year.

            When performing a full revaluation upon rating change, the current
            CRD 3 would allow for discounting with spreads or with historical
            PDs (as used for modelling rating migrations). We assume that the
            section stating that 'The impact of a rating migration on market
            prices may be estimated using either currently observed market data
            (e.g. spreads); or an average of historical market data observed'
            still allows for both choices. Under the provisions of CRD III,
            during a complete revaluation after a rating change, spreads or
            historic PDs may be discounted. We assume that this room for
            discretion is also in line with the rationale behind this
            consultation paper. To our preliminary understanding the option of
            including `upswing estimates' means that such estimates should be
            used during a foreseeable upswing. A potentially required
            simultaneous computation of 'downturn' and `upswing' LGDs is not
            feasible. As has been mentioned above, at present, institutes are
            incapable of implementing these provisions which, besides, would
            also lead to an inadequate risk picture. The requirement to take
            into account that the `impact may be larger than that implied by the
            difference between average market prices or

            The EBA does not believe that historical PDs can be used for
            discounting purposes when performing a full revaluation upon a
            rating change. However, the institution may estimate the impact of
            rating migration on market prices by using either current observed
            market data or an average historical market data observed. The
            relevant question in the context of `an average of historical data
            observed' is how far back the observation period could reach. Over
            one year seems not current enough to calculate a change in current
            market price. Last sentence of para 20.4 regarding `appropriately
            adjustment' has been deleted in the final guidelines to take into
            account the comment.

            little add-on to the IRC figure. One respondent agrees that in
            estimating the impact of a rating migration on market prices firms
            should be allowed to choose between using either currently observed
            market data or an average of historical data observed and that as

            More clarity is needed on the recovery rates/LGDs. It is not clear

            LGDs, nor is it clear how 'downside' and `upside' LGDs should be

            'upside' LGDs to short positions, then (nearly) perfectly matched
            long and short positions would show an inappropriately large net
            loss; On an issuer level there are various recovery rates pertaining

            The valuation of positions has to be based on currently observable

            spreads (and PD/LGD) can be based on through the cycle data, which

            The preference to assign liquidity horizons on product/issuer level
            is extremely granular and not in line with current practice which
            looks at the liquidity of homogenous position classes grouped by
            e.g. product type, issuer type, rating, concentration, etc. The
            rationale behind the preference given to a liquidity horizon at the
            level of product or issuers is not immediately obvious. Such a
            granular vision is not in line with the current practice under which

            In principle, the EBA would like institutions to define liquidity
            horizons as granularly as possible. Product and issuer levels are
            given as examples and paragraph 22.2 clearly states that given the
            practical difficulties that arise, liquidity horizons can be defined

          rating or concentration. The disadvantages of choosing the liquidity
          horizon at product level would be further compounded due to the fact
          that the rating always depends on the issuer: Upon expiry of the
          liquidity horizon, part of the positions of an issuer would see a
          reset back to their original state and part of these positions would
          not see such a reset. As a result, de facto the next simulated period
          would see the emergence of two issuers with diverging rating processes
